    """
    Symbolically compute block tridiagonal terms of the inverse of a *symmetric* block tridiagonal matrix.

    All input & output assumed to be stacked torch tensors. Note that the function expects the off-diagonal
    blocks of the upper triangle & returns the lower-triangle (the transpose). Matrix is assumed symmetric so
    this doesn't really matter, but be careful.
    Input:
    AA - (T x d x d) diagonal blocks
    BB - (T-1 x d x d) off-diagonal blocks (upper triangle)
    iia - (T x 1) block index of AA for the diagonal
    iib - (T-1 x 1) block index of BB for the off-diagonal
    Output:
    D  - (T x d x d) diagonal blocks of the inverse
    OD - (T-1 x d x d) off-diagonal blocks of the inverse (lower triangle)
    S  - (T-1 x d x d) intermediary matrix computation used in inversion algorithm
